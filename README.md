# 2D Graphics Engine

As a part of Duke's CS 345 Computer Graphics course, I implemented a 2D graphics engine in C++. It has functionality for arbitrary polygons, BÃ©zier curves, and custom bitmap/color shaders.

## Installation
Fork the repository and clone it to your local computer, or just clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
cd NNFS-in-cpp
```

Next, cd in one of the projects like pa6-chrisli36 and run
```bash
make
./image
```

## Images
Here are some example images that this engine can draw.
